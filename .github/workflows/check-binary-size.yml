# This workflow checks if a PR commit has changed the size of a hello world Rust program.
# It downloads Rustc and compiles two versions of a stage0 compiler - one using the base commit
# of the PR, and one using the latest commit in the PR.
# If the size of the hello world program has changed, it posts a comment to the PR.
